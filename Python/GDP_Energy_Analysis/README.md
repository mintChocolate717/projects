## **Contents**
```
/data_cleaning
|-- data_cleaning.ipynb   # Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning and initial exploration
|-- raw_data/             # Folder for raw dataset files
|-- cleaned_data/         # Folder for cleaned dataset outputs
```

## **Overview**
This notebook demonstrates the following:
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Identifying and handling missing values.
  - Correcting inconsistent data formats.
  - Filtering and reformatting data for easier analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
  - Generating summary statistics to understand the data.
  - Visualizing distributions and relationships within the dataset.

---

## **How to Use**
1. Place the raw dataset in the `/raw_data` directory.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook data_cleaning.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to perform the data cleaning steps.
4. The cleaned dataset will be saved in the `/cleaned_data` directory for further use.

## **Example Workflow**
### **Input (Raw Data)**:
The raw dataset might include:
- Missing entries
- Outliers
- Inconsistent formatting

### **Output (Cleaned Data)**:
A well-structured dataset ready for deeper analysis:
| Column 1   | Column 2   | Column 3   |
|------------|------------|------------|
| Value 1    | Value 2    | Value 3    |
| Value 4    | Value 5    | Value 6    |

## **Future Steps**
This notebook is part of a larger project and will be extended to:
- Perform advanced data exploration and trend identification.
- Implement predictive modeling and actionable insights.
- Publish findings in the form of reports and visualizations.
